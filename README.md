Dataset Overview
1. Customers
- `customer_id`, `customer_name`, `city_id`
 2. Products
- `product_id`, `product_name`, `price`
3. Sales
- `sale_id`, `sale_date`, `product_id`, `customer_id`, `quantity`, `total_amount`, `rating`

Key Analysis Performed

Data Preparation
- Cleaned null and duplicate entries
- Validated totals: `price × quantity = total_amount`
- Joined tables (`sales`, `customers`, `products`) for integrated analysis

Activity 4: Data Analysis & Aggregation
- Total sales per city
- Total transactions per city
- Unique customers per city
- Average order value per city
- Product demand per city
- Monthly sales trend
- Average product rating per city

Recommendations
- Ranked cities based on total sales, unique customers, and transactions
- Identified top 3 cities with consistent demand and high customer satisfaction

Key Findings

Metric               | Insight |
City_ID 1       | Highest in total sales, orders, and customers |
City_ID 2        | Strong performance and high customer ratings |
City_ID 3        | Solid demand with room for further growth |
Monthly Sales   | Consistent upward trend since launch |
Product Deman   | High and stable for core coffee products |

Final Recommendations

1. Open new coffee shop locations in City_IDs 1, 2, and 3 top performers across all KPIs
2. Stock products based on local demand, especially Coffee Beans, Instant Coffee
3. Target cities with high customer ratings, ensures stronger brand loyalty
4. Avoid low-demand cities, focus investment where demand and satisfaction are proven
5. Use monthly trends to time launches when demand is rising

If a `cities` table is added, City_IDs can be mapped to actual city names. But in this dataset city_name is not included.
